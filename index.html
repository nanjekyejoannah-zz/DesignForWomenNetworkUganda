        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Design for women Network is a team that began during a hackathon during which ladies from differrent backgrounds came up with different solutions to the problems that women are facing today. By the end of that hackathon the team now Design for women Network came up with an application that can bridge the gap between women and their leaders and help the women report cases of violence to their leaders . It also gives reports on violence among women to their leaders so that they can make informed decisions on how to combat the vice. The Idea has been appreciated by different people. The team wrote a paper entitled entitled “Design for women: E-based platform for reporting and visualizing data on violence among women” to be considered for Grace Hopper Conference under the poster track and it was accepted. The reviewers of the paper said the paper proposed a solution to a topic that is unarguably important.The team therefore resolved not to leave such a solution unimplemented because they really think they are solving a global problem that can be solved by no one else but by them as women before the windows of innovation closed.
Other than their interest in innovation for a cause, they are also passionate about impacting the women in STEM. Every lady on this team has a thing for encouraging girls and women to take up STEM related roles. The team is commited to mentorship and training of ladies to improve their skills so that they can favourably compete in their tech(especially software development) related careers.</p>
